#  Student Exam Score Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict students' final exam scores based on key academic features like:
-  Hours Studied
-  Previous Exam Scores
-  Attendance

The project also includes data visualization using **Seaborn** to explore relationships between features and assess correlations.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
