# 🎓 Student Exam Score Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict students' final exam scores based on key academic features like:
- 📚 Hours Studied
- 📊 Previous Exam Scores
- 📅 Attendance

The project also includes data visualization using **Seaborn** to explore relationships between features and assess correlations.
