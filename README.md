#  Student Exam Score Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)** to predict students' final exam scores based on key academic features like:
-  Hours Studied
-  Previous Exam Scores
-  Attendance

The project also includes data visualization using **Seaborn** to explore relationships between features and assess correlations.

---
##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---
##  Files Included
- `student_exam_score_prediction.ipynb` – Main notebook with all code, plots, and outputs
- `requirements.txt` – All required Python libraries to run the notebook

---
##  Features
- Pairplot to visualize relationships between features
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- Linear regression model training & testing
- Actual vs. predicted score comparison
- Model evaluation using MSE and R² score
